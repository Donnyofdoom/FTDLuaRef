# From the Depths Lua Rework reference
A repository containing reference [definition files](https://luals.github.io/wiki/definition-files/) for a reworked lua block api.

Everything is subject to change.

[math.lua](math.d.lua) is incomplete until I get auto generation for C# class to [lua definition](https://luals.github.io/wiki/definition-files/). See the [Unity.Mathematics Docs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.mathematics@1.3/api/index.html) for reference.

This is meant as a sort of RFC to work out a final API that suits the needs.
